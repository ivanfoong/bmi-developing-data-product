## Wikipedia's BMI explaination

The *body mass index* (*BMI*), or *Quetelet index*, is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.

Devised between 1830 and 1850 by the Belgian polymath [Adolphe Quetelet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Quetelet) during the course of developing "social physics", it is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height â€“ with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2
